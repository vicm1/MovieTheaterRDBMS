# MovieTheaterRDBMS

## Overview
Project for one of my database classes. 
##### Goal:
The group created a Movie Theater Ticket DBMS to simplify recording/searching data for Movie Theaters. Whether itâ€™s the record of a movie, customer, ticket order, showtime, or movie theater, all these will be accessible with the DBMS we made for this project.

## Process:
The team made entity and attributes first and then used those for the ER Diagrams before creating the DBMS. Then after the DBMS was created we made our own queries, from beginner to advanced, to show the DBMS was working as intended. At the end mathematical notation was also calculated for most of the queries.

## Hardware/Software:
+ MySQL Workbench 8.0

## RDBMS:
+ MySQL Community Server v8.0.26

## Application Languages:
+ SQL
